I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at [Adaptive Emergent Systems Engineering Laboratory (AESE)](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/aese/) at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) at Imperial College London. I am working under the supervision of [Professor Julie McCann](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.mccann). My research interest is in the field of secured IoT environments. In 2017, I completed my MSc in Electromagnetic Sensor Networks, at the University of Birmingham. The focus of the Masters was on electromagnetic, antennas, propagation, computer communications networks, and RF and microwave engineering. Moreover, I completed my BA in Computer Systems Engineering from Birzeit University in Palestine.
